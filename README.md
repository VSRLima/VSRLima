## Hello people!! 👋
Hello, my name is Vinicius Reis, and I'm a FullStack Developer with a strong foundation in project management and technical innovation. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working across diverse industries, contributing to impactful projects, and mastering a wide array of tools and technologies.

Currently, I work at a global company specializing in marketing technologies, where we leverage AI-driven solutions to deliver personalized advertising and targeted customer engagement. In this role, I’ve led the technical aspects of online campaigns, ensuring seamless integration with client e-commerce systems. I’ve also developed internal tools using Node.js, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js to optimize campaign operations, enhance efficiency, and improve user experience.
To ensure smooth and reliable development workflows, I’ve implemented continuous integration and deployment pipelines using Jenkins and incorporated robust testing practices with Jest and Jasmine. My work with BigQuery has provided actionable insights for campaign strategies, and tools like Google Tag Manager have helped streamline analytics for better tracking and optimization.

Previously, I collaborated with a company specializing in geographic information systems and geospatial data services. There, I played a key role in maintaining and enhancing systems for electric utility projects, such as managing data for utility poles and transformers.
My contributions ranged from streamlining team workflows to supporting new team members and developing scalable, high-performance applications using Angular, TypeScript, .NET, and Xamarin. I also ensured quality through unit testing with XUnit and used Azure DevOps to optimize deployment pipelines.

Before that, I worked with a company focused on designing protective cases and accessories for mobile devices. I interacted directly with system users to analyze and resolve issues while also developing internal dashboards to improve functionality and data visualization.
My work involved containerization with Docker, version control with Git and GitHub, and development using Angular, TypeScript, PHP, and WordPress. This role required meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to exceeding user expectations, which allowed me to deliver outstanding support and solutions.

Across all these experiences, I’ve developed a passion for creating innovative, user-focused solutions while continuously optimizing processes and workflows. My expertise spans a range of technologies, from front-end tools like Vue.js, Angular, and TypeScript, to back-end solutions with .NET, PostgreSQL, and Azure DevOps.
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my professional journey. I’m excited about the future and the opportunity to contribute my skills to your organization’s success.

I look forward to connecting with you and exploring how we can achieve great things together.
